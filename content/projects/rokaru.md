**Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs)** play a significant part in Indonesia's economic growth. In 2018, SMEs alone contributed **over US$600 trillion**, which is **over 57% of Indonesia's GDP**. Amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, this productivity has been crippled to the point where consumers spending has declined, which ultimately resulted in **many of these businesses gone bust**. This decline was largely attributed to the **restricted movement** to the premises of these largely offline SMEs. 
<br>
<br>
Rokaru aims to alleviate this problem by **bringing these businesses to the consumers**, instead of the other way around by providing these businesses a digital platform where they can sell their goods virtually. Unlike neighboring apps, Rokaru was designed to have a **simple and user-friendly interface** without user-confusing features.

Rokaru was made by Team 👁👄👁, which consists of myself, Andrew Cen, and Andrew Martin Tan, and won **<Hyperlink to="https://socs.binus.ac.id/2020/12/18/mahasiswa-mat-menjuarai-kompetisi-socs-hackathon-2020/" external>first place</Hyperlink>** in the **2020 BINUS School of Computer Science Hackathon**.
