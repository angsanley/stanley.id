**Empowering Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises**

Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are pivotal contributors to Indonesia's economic growth, accounting for over 57% of the country's GDP, with a staggering US$600 trillion generated in 2018. However, the pandemic's impact has been severe, causing a decline in consumer spending, leading to business closures. This decline was further exacerbated by the limitations placed on offline SMEs due to the COVID-19 crisis.

## Rokaru: A Digital Solution for SMEs

Amid these challenges, Rokaru emerges as a beacon of hope. By flipping the traditional business-consumer relationship, Rokaru extends a lifeline to SMEs. It provides these businesses with a robust digital platform to virtually showcase and sell their products, thereby bridging the gap created by the pandemic. In contrast to similar apps, Rokaru boasts a simple, user-friendly interface, eliminating complexity for users.

## From Vision to Reality

Rokaru was birthed by Team üëÅüëÑüëÅ, a trio comprising myself, Andrew Cen, and Andrew Martin Tan. Our efforts culminated in securing <Hyperlink to="https://socs.binus.ac.id/2020/12/18/mahasiswa-mat-menjuarai-kompetisi-socs-hackathon-2020/" external>first place</Hyperlink> in the esteemed 2020 BINUS School of Computer Science Hackathon. Our journey is encapsulated in this engaging presentation video (in Bahasa Indonesia):
