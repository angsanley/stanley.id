**Tamago: Teaching Kids to Save with Interaction**

Crafted as part of the Compfest Innovative App 2019, Tamago stands as a digital piggy bank app designed specifically to aid young parents in teaching their children the art of saving money in an engaging and interactive manner.

## Navigating Children's Financial Futures

In the ever-evolving landscape of the Cashless Society, electronic transactions continue to surge. Statistics from Bank Indonesia reveal that in 2018 alone, the total electronic transactions reached 3.9 billion with a nominal value of 47.1 trillion Rupiah. Despite the convenience offered by fintech transactions, there's an increasing concern about the consumerist tendencies that may arise among financially unaware children.

## Instilling the Savings Habit

Instilling the habit of saving money from an early age is crucial. However, contemporary savings often take the form of bank accounts initiated by parents. While this prepares for the future, children might lose sight of the importance of independently managing their finances. This shift has led to the necessity of finding creative ways to teach financial literacy to the next generation.

## The Birth of Tamago

Born out of these considerations: Tamago, the Digital Piggy Bank App. Tamago is crafted to emulate the experience of traditional piggy banks while adapting to modern trends and technologies. Its usage mechanism is simple: a click to deposit coins. The coins, corresponding to predetermined denominations (default: Rp 1,000), are drawn from the linked digital wallet and stored within the virtual piggy bank shaped like an egg.

## Visualizing Savings

One of the challenges encountered by models like Tamago is visualizing savings. In traditional piggy banks, the accumulation of savings is tactileâ€”quantifiable by weight or even visually evident in transparent piggy banks. To address this, Tamago's design adapts its egg-shaped piggy bank's appearance based on the amount of virtual money saved within the app.

Stay tuned as we explore how Tamago reshapes children's financial literacy, turning savings into a delightful journey.
