**Every human being wishes to be born perfect, yet some are not as lucky as others**. In BINUS University alone, **dozens of students** with hearing and speech impairment are admitted **every year**. Their circumstances pose challenges in understanding lecture delivery, thus crippling comprehension, deteriorating performance, hence increasing tuition fees due to extended candidature.
<br>
<br>
Enter ADAB, a project aiming to help these students **by enhancing their learning experience** with an e-learning platform powered by speech-to-text.
