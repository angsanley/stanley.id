In a world where everyone aspires to be born perfect, the reality is not always so. Within BINUS University, a significant number of students with hearing and speech impairment are admitted annually. This unique situation presents challenges in comprehending lectures, adversely affecting performance and extending learning periods, ultimately leading to increased tuition fees.

As the <hyperlink to="https://github.com/bearcatsdev" external>Bearcats Developer Team</hyperlink>, guided by the visionary Mrs. Sonya R. Manalu, we embarked on a remarkable journey to develop ADAB. This innovative project is aimed at enriching the learning experience for these students by introducing an e-learning platform powered by state-of-the-art speech-to-text technology.

## A Journey Through Time

ADAB's origin story can be traced back to the BIOS hackathon held at Multimedia Nusantara University, Tangerang. Within just 24 hours, our progress propelled us to become one of the top eight finalists. This achievement earned us a coveted year-long mentorship program, which unfortunately was terminated halfway through its duration.

## A Government-Backed Evolution

With the invaluable support of the Indonesian Ministry of Research and Technology (Kemenristekdikti), we expanded ADAB from its prototype stage into a fully functional product. In close collaboration with the Student Advisory & Support Center at BINUS University, we fine-tuned the app to cater seamlessly to the unique needs of its users.

## Navigating the Technical Realm

ADAB offers accessibility through both web and mobile platforms. The web app was constructed using Vue.js, while the Android app, natively developed, boasts iOS support on the horizon. Both iterations are powered by an Express backend, supported by a MySQL database.

During its developmental phase, Chrome and Android's native speech-to-text API facilitated real-time transcription of lecturers' words into text, relayed to students via Socket.io. Our roadmap includes transitioning to Google Cloud Speech to Text API in the near future.

## Celebrating Impact and Expressing Gratitude

Witnessing the positive response from ADAB's users has been a source of immense satisfaction. It's heartwarming to know that our project is contributing to creating a better world.

We extend our heartfelt gratitude to all contributors and to the dedicated team that will carry forward this endeavor beyond our university journey.
